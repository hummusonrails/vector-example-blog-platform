## ✨ Project Overview

This project is a full-featured blog platform demonstrating vector search, hybrid search, and modern backend patterns using:
- **Express.js** for the web server
- **Couchbase** as the database
- **Ottoman.js** for ODM
- **OpenAI** (or compatible) for generating embeddings
- Modular, testable, and production-ready code structure

Each chapter branch is carefully aligned with the book’s content.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hummusonrails/vector-example-blog-platform.git
   cd vector-example-blog-platform
   ```
2. **Checkout a chapter branch (optional):**
   ```sh
   git checkout chapter-7  # Or any other chapter branch
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the app:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   npm start
   ```

## ✅ Known Environment

- Node.js 20 LTS or 22 LTS

## 🔧 Configuration

Set these environment variables before starting the app:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for embedding generation
- `DB_ENDPOINT` - Couchbase connection string (default: `couchbase://localhost`)
- `DB_BUCKET` - Couchbase bucket name (default: `default`)
- `DB_USERNAME` - Couchbase username (default: `Administrator`)
- `DB_PASSWORD` - Couchbase password (default: `password`)
- `DB_SCOPE` - Couchbase scope name (default: `_default`)

To run tests:

```sh
npm test
```
