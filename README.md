## About This Chapter

- Introduces vector search with a hands-on script.
- Scrapes book titles from Pragmatic Bookshelf.
- Uses OpenAI to generate embeddings and compare your proposed book title.
- No Express app or backend; this is a standalone script.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install node-fetch dotenv cheerio
   ```
2. Add your OpenAI API key to a `.env` file.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   node name_this_book.js "Your Book Title"
   ```
