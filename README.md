## ✨ Project Overview

This project is a full-featured blog platform demonstrating vector search, hybrid search, and modern backend patterns using:
- **Express.js** for the web server
- **Couchbase** as the database
- **Ottoman.js** for ODM
- **OpenAI** (or compatible) for generating embeddings
- Modular, testable, and production-ready code structure

Each chapter branch is carefully aligned with the book’s content.
