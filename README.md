# Chapter 3: Foundation of the Express App

This branch contains the foundational code for Chapter 3 of "Vector Search with JavaScript." Here, youâ€™ll find the initial Express app structure, setup for embeddings, and the base project layout that subsequent chapters will build upon.

## About This Chapter

- Introduces the foundational Express app for the vector search platform.
- Sets up the core project structure and dependencies.
- Lays the groundwork for using embeddings in future chapters.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up your environment variables in `.env` (see `.env.example` for required keys).
3. Start the app in development mode:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Or start the app in production mode:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### Generating an Embedding (Chapter 3 Example)

To generate a vector embedding for any string using the OpenAI API, run:

```sh
node generate_embedding.js "Your text string goes here"
```

This will output the embedding vector, the model used, and the number of tokens consumed. You must have your OpenAI API key set in your `.env` file for this to work.

For more details, see comments in the codebase and the book text for this chapter.
