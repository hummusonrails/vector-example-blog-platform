## About This Chapter

- Demonstrates vector math and similarity with a fruit example.
- Shows how cosine similarity and dot product work.
- No Express app or backend; this is a standalone demo script.

## How to Run

1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   node understanding_vector_search/similarity_applies_bananas_oranges.js
   ```
